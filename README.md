# Twitter-Clone

This app emulates both the look and many of the features of, Twitter, The social media website. I built this using the MERN stack technologies (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows a user to create a profile and start writing/liking tweets and following other users. There is a home page that only shows tweets from users you follow, an explore page which shows all user tweets in order of most liked, and a profile page which shows only that user's tweets, as well as their selected profile picture. I may add more features in the future.
